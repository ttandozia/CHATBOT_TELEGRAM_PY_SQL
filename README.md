**Hello!**

Implementation of a Chatbot to work with Pizza orders. Built with Telegram API, pYTHON and sql. Using 2 approches with Machine Learning models:

* To predict and suggest pizza toppings to clients;
* To analyze post-sale feedback and comments.

Models implemented:

* Random Forest;
* Logistic regression;
* Naive Bayes;
* KNN;
* Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF);
* Bag of words (BOW).

The BOW and TF-IDF was made with a tweet file.

In the "Jupyter" file you will find the construction of the models.
In the ".py" file you can analyze the implementation of the Bot and use of the models built in jupyter.

**Important:** This project was built for a Brazilian client, so the features, objects, and models have their names in Portuguese.

**Conclusion:**
